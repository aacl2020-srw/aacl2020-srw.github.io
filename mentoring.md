# Mentoring

## Pre-submission Mentorship Program
The SRW offers students the opportunity to get feedback in advance to submitting their work for review. The goal of the pre-submission mentorship program is to improve the quality of writing and presentation of the studentâ€™s work, not to critique the work itself. Participation is optional but encouraged and pre-submission mentorship is not anonymous.
Students wishing to participate must submit the paper by __August 28, 2020__ to the START conference system: [https://www.softconf.com/aacl-ijcnlp2020/SRW/](https://www.softconf.com/aacl-ijcnlp2020/SRW/).

Note that even though the mentoring is not done anonymously, the paper needs to be __anonymized__. We will check for formality of the paper including formatting before we match mentors.

Participants will receive a mentor who will review and provide feedback to the student within 2-3 weeks. This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission. The feedback will be in the format of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing; students are not required to make the changes suggested by the pre-submission mentor.

## Mentoring of Accepted Papers

There will also be mentors who provide feedback to students in the form of in-depth comments and questions for the workshop presentation.
