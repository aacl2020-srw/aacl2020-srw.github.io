#### Topic
__Societal Impacts of NLP: How and When to Integrate Them into Your Research (and How to Make Time for That)__

#### Abstract
In March 2020, the ACL adopted the ACM's Code of Ethics and, beginning with EMNLP 2020, ACL conferences have included ethical considerations in the review process.
In this talk, I will put these developments into historical perspective, talk about the kinds of risks that give rise to them, and explore positive steps that all NLP researchers can take to increase the chances that our time, effort and creativity are put towards work that is helpful for people, especially those who have been subject to marginalization.

#### Biography 
Emily M. Bender is a professor of linguistics at the University of Washington where she is the faculty director of the professional MS program in computational linguistics. 
Her research interests include the interaction of linguistics and NLP and the societal impact of language technology and how transparent documentation can help mitigate the effects of bias and the potential for trained systems to perpetuate systems of oppression. 
She is also actively working on how to best incorporate training on ethics and societal impact into NLP curricula.
